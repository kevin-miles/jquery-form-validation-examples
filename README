jQuery Form Validation Examples
===============================

These examples are based on the plain javascript form validation examples located at:
  https://github.com/nested/javascript-form-validation-examples

Internet connection required.
All examples use HTML to request jQuery from the jQuery CDN. An example URL used is: 
  http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.0.min.js
If you do not have an active internet connection, you must supply your own local jQuery script. 
Otherwise the javascript will fail to execute as expected.
